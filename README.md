# A successful classifer for predicting the direction of next day close 

This classifier is designed to predict whether tomorrow's close will be higher or lower than today. The code also includes a backtest result which shows
that it can provide promising results atleast for one stock which it has been trained on

## TODO:
1) Apply the same classifier on other stocks
2) Use different algorithms to see if results are better
3) Add transaction costs and make the backtest more detailed
